# Introduction to JavaScript

Let's get some hands-on practice writing JavaScript code. You should **fork and clone** this repository first.

## Step 1

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed!

## Step 2

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory that you cloned this repo into locally. Then run the `main.js` file:

`node main.js`

You will see a bunch of messages in the terminal! These are test failures that you must make pass.

## Step 3

Read all of the `TODO` items in the `main.js` file. Write your own JavaScript code for each TODO! As you complete tasks you will see that the tests will begin to pass, one by one.
