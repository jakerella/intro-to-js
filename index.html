        <p>
            Open up this directory in your code editor and then open the "code.js" file in the "js" directory. There are specific tasks in that file that you must complete. Once you have written your code, return to this page, <strong>refresh the page</strong>, then view any errors or other messages in the "console" in Chrome's developer tools (you can open that with "option+command+i"). <strong>Do not edit anything at the bottom of that file</strong>, that is code to ensure the code you wrote works (the tests)!
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Write some code in js/code.js</li>
            <li>Save that file and refresh this page</li>
            <li>Look in the developer console for any messages (and possibly errors)</li>
        </ol>
